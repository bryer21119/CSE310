# Overview

What I am trying to accomplish with this project is to learn how to create an application that would be useful for students for studying their homework.

The application I created is for students and is a flash card app that shows the question on one side and on the reverse side of the card it shows the answer to the question. To use this application there is a button at the bottom of the card that shows flip and you can flip back and forth from question to answer to see if you have correctly answered the question.

To help students with learning their assignments questions and helping to instill the correct answer in them.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

Some of the tools I used to develop the application were w3schools, youtube, and stackexchange.

Java and the libraries I used to build the application were import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.ActionEvent; import java.awt.event.ActionListener;

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

* Make it so that the list of questions and answers shows up on the flash cards.
* Make it so that the program goes to the next flash card after the first answer has been revealed.
* Invest more time into my project and make sure to do more research.
